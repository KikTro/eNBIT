# eNBIT
A free to download browser for all your needs taking least resources possible

eNBIT from KikTro pvt. is one of the least batterry, resource, internet and memory consuming web browsers on the planet.
This idea came from Krishnendu Halder. His intention was to create a resource efficient web browser for all those people with a low end phone,
or less internet or bad battery backup but with features of a well developed full fledged web browser. The browser also posseses a feature called
"Reader Mode" not available in most browsers, which when enabled, lets you read the contents of a site as a book with a clean grey-black background
without any pictures, making it use even less amount of batterry , data and resource.
